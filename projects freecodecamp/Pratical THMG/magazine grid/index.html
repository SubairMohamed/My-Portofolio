                    Soon the freeCodeCamp curriculum will be 100% project-driven learning. Instead of a series of coding
                    challenges,
                    you'll learn through building projects - step by step. Before we get into the details, let me
                    emphasize:
                    we are
                    not changing the certifications. All 6 certifications will still have the same 5 required projects.
                    We
                    are only
                    changing the optional coding challenges.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After years - years - of pondering these two problems and how to solve them, I slipped, hit my head
                    on
                    the sink,
                    and when I came to I had a revelation! A vision! A picture in my head! A picture of this! This is
                    what
                    makes
                    time travel possible: the flux capacitor!
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-2">
                <p>
                    It wasn't as dramatic as Doc's revelation in Back to the Future. It
                    just occurred to me while I was going for a run. The revelation: the entire curriculum should be a
                    series of
                    projects. Instead of individual coding challenges, we'll just have projects, each with their own
                    seamless series
                    of tests. Each test gives you just enough information to figure out how to get it to pass. (And you
                    can
                    view
                    hints if that isn't enough.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    No more walls of explanatory text. No more walls of tests. Just one
                    test at a time, as you build up a working project. Over the course of passing thousands of tests,
                    you
                    build up
                    projects and your own understanding of coding fundamentals.
