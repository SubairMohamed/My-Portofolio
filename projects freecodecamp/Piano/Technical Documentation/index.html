      <p>
        JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
        is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
        example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
        its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
      </p>
      <p>
        JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
        Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators,
        control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended
        for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects;
        for example:
      </p>
      <ul class="ul-indent">
        <li>
          Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
          objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
          For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
          elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse
          clicks, form input, and page navigation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
          objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,
          server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
          database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to
          another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a
          server.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="What you should already know">
      <h2 id="What you should already know">What you should already know</h2>
      <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
      <ul class="ul-indent">
        <li>
          A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web
          (WWW).
        </li>
        <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
        <li>
          Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one
          of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="Javascript and Java">
      <h2 id="Javascript and Java">Javascript and Java</h2>
      <p>
        JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally
        different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but
        does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
        JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and
        basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed
        from LiveScript to JavaScript.
      </p>
      <p>
        In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
        declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
        number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.
        JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more
        common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides
        dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for
        individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any
        special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of
        objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not
        have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have
        to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
        protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables,
        parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="Hello world">
      <h2 id="Hello world">Hello world</h2>
      <p>
        To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write
        your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
          greetMe("World");
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your
        browser!
      </p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="Variables">
      <h2 id="Variables">Variables</h2>
      <p>
        You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.
        The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
        dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9).
        Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters
        "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z"
        (lowercase).
      </p>
      <p>
        You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in
        identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as
        characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are
        Number_hits, temp99, and _name.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="Declaring variables">
      <h2 id="Declaring variables">Declaring variables</h2>
      <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
      <p>With the keyword var. For example,</p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          var x = 42.
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
      </p>
      <p>By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>
      <pre>
         <code>
          x = 42.
         </code>
       </pre>
      <p>
        This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict
        JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
      </p>
      <p>With the keyword let. For example,</p>
      <pre>
         <code>
          let y = 13.
         </code>
       </pre>
      <p>
        This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See
        Variable scope below.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="Variable scope">
      <h2 id="Variable scope">Variable scope</h2>
      <p>
        When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
        global variable, because it is available to any other code in the
        current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is
        called a local variable, because it is available only within that
        function.
      </p>
      <p>
        JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope;
        rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function
        (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the
        following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or
        global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in
        this case is an if statement.
      </p>
      <pre>
         <code>
    if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5
         </code>
       </pre>
      <p>
        This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in
        ECMAScript 2015.
      </p>
      <pre>
         <code>
            if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is
            not defined
         </code>
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="Global variale">
      <h2 id="Global variale">Global variale</h2>
      <p>
        Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web
        pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global
        variables using the window.variable syntax.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window
        or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or
        frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared
        in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as
        parent.phoneNumber.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="Constants">
      <h2 id="Constants">Constants</h2>
      <p>
        You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The
        syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable
        identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and
        can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
      </p>
      <pre>
         <code>
            const PI = 3.14;
         </code>
        </pre>
      <p>
        A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared
        while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.
      </p>
      <p>
        The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block
        scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is
        assumed to represent a variable.
      </p>
      <p>
        You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or
        variable in the same scope. For example:
      </p>
      <pre>
         <code>
            // THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS
               WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g;
            //statements }
         </code>
        </pre>
      <p>
        However, object attributes are not protected, so the following
        statement is executed without problems.
      </p>
      <pre>
         <code>
            const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key =
            "otherValue";
         </code>
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="Data types">
      <h2 id="Data types">Data types</h2>
      <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
      <ul class="ul-indent">
        <li>Six data types that are primitives:</li>
        <dd>Boolean. true and false.</dd>
        <dd>
          null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is
          case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other
          variant.
        </dd>
        <dd>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</dd>
        <dd>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</dd>
        <dd>String. "Howdy"</dd>
        <dd>
          Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are
          unique and immutable.
        </dd>
        <li>and Object</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable
        you to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and
        functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can
        think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as
        procedures that your application can perform.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="If...else statement">
      <h2 id="If...else statement">If...else statement</h2>
      <p>
        Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is
        true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the
        condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:
      </p>
      <pre>
         <code>
            if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }
         </code>
        </pre>
      <p>
        condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See
        Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If
        condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise,
        statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any
        statement, including further nested if statements.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple
        conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
      </p>
      <pre>
         <code>
            if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) {
              statement_2; } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else {
              statement_last; }
         </code>
       </pre>
      <p>
        In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition
        which evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple
        statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In
        general, it's good practice to always use block statements, especially
        when nesting if statements:
      </p>
      <pre>
          <code>
            if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
              statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
              statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
              statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }
         </code>
        </pre>
      <p>
        It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional
        expression, because the assignment can be confused with equality when
        glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following code:
      </p>
      <code>
          <pre>
            if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }
          </pre>
        </code>
      <p>
        If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a common
        practice is to put additional parentheses around the assignment. For
        example:
      </p>
      <pre>
          <code>
            if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }
          </code>
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="While statement">
      <h2 id="While statement">While statement</h2>
      <p>
        A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified
        condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:
      </p>
      <pre>
         <code>
          while (condition) statement
         </code>
        </pre>
      <p>
        If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops
        executing and control passes to the statement following the loop.
      </p>
      <p>
        The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If
        the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is
        tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and
        control is passed to the statement following while.
      </p>
      <p>
        To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to
        group those statements.
      </p>
      <p>Example:</p>
      <p>
        The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:
      </p>
      <pre>
         <code>
            var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n < 3) { n++; x += n; }
         </code>
        </pre>
      <p>
        With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x.
        Therefore, x and n take on the following values:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
        <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
        <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        After completing the third pass, the condition n < 3 is no longer true, so the loop terminates. </p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="Function declaration">
      <h2 id="Function declaration">Function declaration</h2>
      <p>
        A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function
        statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The name of the function.</li>
        <li>
          A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and
          separated by commas.
        </li>
        <li>
          The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in
          curly brackets, { }.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For example, the following code defines a simple function named
        square:
      </p>
      <pre>
          <code>
            function square(number) { return number * number; }
          </code>
        </pre>
      <p>
        The function square takes one argument, called number. The function
        consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the
        function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement
        specifies the value returned by the function.
      </p>
      <pre>
         <code>
            return number * number;
         </code>
        </pre>
      <p>
        Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by
        value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function
        changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected
        globally or in the calling function.
