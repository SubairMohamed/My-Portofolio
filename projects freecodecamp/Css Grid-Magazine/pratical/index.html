                Soon the freeCodeCamp curriculum will be 100% project-driven learning. Instead of a series of coding
                challenges,
                you'll learn through building projects - step by step. Before we get into the details, let me emphasize:
                we are
                not changing the certifications. All 6 certifications will still have the same 5 required projects. We
                are only
                changing the optional coding challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
                After years - years - of pondering these two problems and how to solve them, I slipped, hit my head on
                the sink,
                and when I came to I had a revelation! A vision! A picture in my head! A picture of this! This is what
                makes
                time travel possible: the flux capacitor!
            </p>
            <p>
                It wasn't as dramatic as Doc's revelation in Back to the Future. It
                just occurred to me while I was going for a run. The revelation: the entire curriculum should be a
                series of
                projects. Instead of individual coding challenges, we'll just have projects, each with their own
                seamless series
                of tests. Each test gives you just enough information to figure out how to get it to pass. (And you can
                view
                hints if that isn't enough.)
